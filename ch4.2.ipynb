    "Evalutaing `(factorial 5)` will *not* work in an applicative order language. Both branches of the `unless` expression are evalutated regardless of the predicate value. When `n == 1`, `(* 1 (factorial 0))` will be evaluated instead of terminating using the `usual-value` branch of `1`. This will lead to `(* 0 (factorial -1))` being evaluated and so on, causing the procedure to run infinitely.\n",

    "In a normal order language, the procedure will work as expected. Since the branches of the `unless` expression are only evaluated when needed, the procedure will terminate when `n == 1` with the `usual-branch` evaluation of `1`. The `exceptional-value` won't be evaluated, preventing the infinite loop encountered in the applicative order language."
