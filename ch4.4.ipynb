This could be implemented at the evaluator level, by tracking intermediate results from `query pattern` in association with the sub-query that produced the result and the current frame.\n",

    "For example, the result `(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))` returned from the `wheel` sub-query would be stored under a `wheel` key for the current environment. A subsequent result from `(wheel ?who)` that would return `(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))` would be found to already be present and then not included in the returned result set. Storing values in association with *both* the current frame and sub-query is important to adhere to the query evaluator's unification rules - the 'parallel' evaluation of `or` and the serial evaluation of `and` is handled by capturing the current frame for the sub-query."
