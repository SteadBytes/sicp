    "Evalutaing `(factorial 5)` will *not* work in an applicative order language. Both branches of the `unless` expression are evalutated regardless of the predicate value. When `n == 1`, `(* 1 (factorial 0))` will be evaluated instead of terminating using the `usual-value` branch of `1`. This will lead to `(* 0 (factorial -1))` being evaluated and so on, causing the procedure to run infinitely.\n",

    "In a normal order language, the procedure will work as expected. Since the branches of the `unless` expression are only evaluated when needed, the procedure will terminate when `n == 1` with the `usual-branch` evaluation of `1`. The `exceptional-value` won't be evaluated, preventing the infinite loop encountered in the applicative order language."

Since we are exploring the change in paradigm of a lazy evaluator I prefer the original approach in the text as, although it may require some adjustment in thinking, it offers a different and interesting approach to modelling computation."

    "The addition of controlling whether arguments are delayed has introduced an overall performance decrease (compare results to ex 4.29). This is likely due to inefficiencies in the `add-arguments-to-env` procedure during 'pattern matching' each argument type. This could almost certainly be improved however for the purpose of this exercise it is sufficient and the procedure itself is clear enough to understand the process (optimising for performance may reduce readability)."
